# EventPlanner
An event planning system with functioning UI and JDBC for data storage

This system was created using NetBeans IDE 8.2
It hasn't been compiled yet, its raw codes.

It was my first try at programming.
It follows the DAO pattern and all code was written solely by me.

It allows easy planning by extracting preferable timesolts of various users and then analyzing the optimal timeslot for the event.
It also notifies the user of any invitation where they can RSVP.

That said, the system is very rudamentary and only has a local scope.
